# ML1M-report
Creation of reports on Movielens 1M dataset (available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/ )

The report.py script needs the three files from the dataset: ratings.dat, movies.dat and users.dat
And it creates a ML1M-report.pdf file as output

The scriot can be run as:
python report.py --ratingsfile /PATH/ --usersfile /PATH/ --moviesfile /PATH/

Note: These arguments are not needed if the three files (ratings.dat, movies.dat and users.dat) are in the same folder as report.py
